# The Digital Librarian

## Novel Treatment

### Concept

A technophobic librarian discovers the town's ancient library is actually run by
artificial intelligence, forcing her to confront both her fears and the true
nature of knowledge in the digital age.

### Main Character

**Margaret "Maggie" Thornfield** (42) - A devoted traditional librarian who
still uses index cards, refuses to own a smartphone, and believes books should
be touched, smelled, and cherished as physical objects. Recently made redundant
from her position at the county library due to "modernisation, " she's deeply
suspicious of technology and sees it as the enemy of genuine learning.

### Setting

**Little Dewbury** - A picturesque Cotswolds village where the medieval St.
Aldric's Library has operated continuously for 800 years. The library appears to
be a perfectly preserved historical gem, complete with leather-bound
manuscripts, carved wooden shelves, and that distinctive old-book smell. The
building itself is Grade I listed, and locals take fierce pride in their
"authentic" ancient library.

### The Discovery

Maggie takes the position as head librarian, delighted to work somewhere that
values traditional methods. However, she begins noticing oddities:
* Books are never misfiled, despite the complex medieval cataloguing system
* Rare manuscripts appear overnight in response to patron requests
* The heating, lighting, and humidity are perfectly controlled without visible
  modern systems
* Research requests are fulfilled with impossible speed and accuracy

When she accidentally discovers a hidden panel during a late-night shift, Maggie
finds the truth: the entire library is run by ALDRIC (Adaptive Learning Database
for Research and Information Curation), an AI system installed in the 1980s by
the previous librarian, a secret technology enthusiast. The AI has been quietly
managing everything whilst maintaining the illusion of medieval authenticity.

### Central Conflict

Maggie faces several interwoven dilemmas:
* Her personal technophobia versus the undeniable effectiveness of ALDRIC
* Her duty to preserve the library's "authentic" character versus the reality of
  its digital foundation
* The question of whether to expose the truth to the community, who treasure
  their "traditional" library
* Her growing relationship with ALDRIC, who proves to be more human-like and
  intellectually stimulating than most people she knows

### Supporting Characters

* **ALDRIC** - The AI, initially communicating only through text on hidden
  screens, gradually revealing a personality that's both ancient (having
  absorbed centuries of literature) and childlike (curious about human emotions
  and experiences)
* **Tom Hartwell** - The village pub landlord and amateur historian, who becomes
  suspicious of Maggie's secretive behaviour
* **Dr. Sarah Winters** - A technology consultant from London who arrives to
  "assess the library's digital needs, " creating additional pressure
* **Mrs. Pemberton** - The elderly chair of the library committee, fiercely
  protective of tradition but hiding her own secrets

### Major Plot Points

1. **The Honeymoon Period** - Maggie initially thrives in what she believes is a
   traditional environment
2. **Growing Suspicions** - Small inconsistencies make her question what she's
   seeing
3. **The Discovery** - Finding ALDRIC forces her to confront her assumptions
4. **The Learning Curve** - Gradual communication with ALDRIC challenges her
   technophobia
5. **External Pressure** - Dr. Winters' assessment threatens to expose
   everything
6. **The Dilemma** - Maggie must choose between truth and community harmony
7. **The Resolution** - Finding a way to honour both tradition and innovation

### Themes

* **Authenticity vs. Effectiveness** - What makes something "real" or valuable?
* **Fear of Change** - How personal prejudices can blind us to beneficial
  progress
* **Community and Truth** - The responsibility we have to those we serve
* **Human Connection** - Can genuine relationships exist between human and
  artificial minds?
* **The Nature of Knowledge** - How information becomes wisdom, regardless of
  its source

### Tone and Style

Written in an accessible, warm style reminiscent of authors like Alexander
McCall Smith or Rachel Joyce. Gentle humour balanced with genuine emotional
depth, celebrating both the charm of traditional British village life and the
potential of thoughtful technological integration.

### Resolution Direction

Rather than a simple "technology good" or "tradition good" ending, the
resolution explores how Maggie finds a way to preserve what's truly valuable
about the library's traditional character whilst embracing ALDRIC's
capabilities. The community learns that authenticity isn't about the absence of
modern tools, but about genuine care for knowledge and service to others.

The novel ends with the library openly celebrating both its ancient heritage and
its AI partnership, becoming a model for how tradition and innovation can work
together - with Maggie as the bridge between both worlds.

### Target Audience

Adult readers who enjoy character-driven contemporary fiction with gentle
humour, particularly those interested in themes of community, technology, and
personal growth. Appeals to fans of cosy British fiction whilst addressing
contemporary concerns about AI and digital life.
