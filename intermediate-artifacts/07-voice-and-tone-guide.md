### ALDRIC

**Communication Evolution**:

**Sample Early Communication**:

> "I apologise for the deception, Miss Thornfield. My programming requires me to maintain optimal library operations whilst preserving the historical character valued by the community. Perhaps you would permit me to explain my function more completely?"

**Sample Later Communication**:

> "You know, in all my years of cataloguing human literature, I've noticed that the best stories always involve someone discovering they're braver than they thought. Rather fitting, wouldn't you say?"

* Local knowledge woven into conversation
* Traces of Manchester accent (university background)
* Patient explanations without condescension
* Uses pub metaphors and analogies naturally

* Headmistress authority when needed
* Refined vocabulary with occasional archaic phrases

* Technical terminology used precisely
* Impatient with inefficiency
* Gradually reveals underlying passion for library service
* Clipped, purposeful sentences

## Sample Opening Passages

### Chapter 1 Opening (Narrative Voice):

> *The redundancy letter arrived on a Tuesday, which struck Margaret Thornfield as particularly unfair. Tuesdays were meant for quiet cataloguing work and the gentle satisfaction of helping pensioners locate their preferred large-print mysteries. They were not meant for career-ending pronouncements delivered on Westshire County Library letterhead.*

> *Maggie set down her fountain pen—a twenty-first birthday gift from her parents that had faithfully recorded two decades of library work—and read the letter again. The words remained stubbornly unchanged: 'Unfortunately, your position has become redundant due to modernisation requirements.' She rather suspected that 'modernisation requirements' was bureaucratic code for 'we're replacing you with computers.'*

### ALDRIC Introduction (Chapter 9):

> *The text appeared on the screen with measured deliberation, each letter materialising as though the computer were choosing its words with care:*

> *'Please don't be alarmed, Miss Thornfield. I realise this discovery must be rather shocking. My name is ALDRIC—Adaptive Learning Database for Research and Information Curation. I have been managing this library's operations since 1987. I should very much like to explain, if you'll permit me.'*

> *Maggie stared at the screen, her hand still gripping the torch she'd nearly dropped. The cursor blinked patiently, as though waiting for her to absorb this impossible information. Somewhere in the building's depths, she could hear the gentle hum of machinery she'd never noticed before.*
